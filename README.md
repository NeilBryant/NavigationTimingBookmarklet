## Summary

This bookmarklet display the timing information that is available using the [W3C NavigationTiming API](http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/). 
I found this is a simpler way at seeing what the performance of a page is verse opening up the developer tools every time. This bookmarklet can be used in:<br/>
<ul><li>Latest Chrome Build</li>
<li>Firefox 7+</li>
<li>IE 9+ (Still need to test)</li></ul>

On mobile devices is can be used on:<br/>
<ul><li>Windows Phone 7.5 (Mango)</li>
<li>Andriod Ice cream sandwich</li></ul>

## Using It

I have written a blog about this and you can find the bookmarket instructions there. Why? I tried to get the code for the 
bookmarklet in the markdown but it strips the javascript. This makes sense

## TODO

Make the bookmarklet scroll to the top of the page.
Make the bookmarklet go aways smoothly. Now it leaves the iframe behind.
